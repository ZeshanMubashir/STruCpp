# STruC++ - Structured Text to C++ Compiler

**STruC++** is a modern, maintainable compiler for IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) programs that generates efficient, real-time capable C++ code. It is designed to replace MatIEC in the OpenPLC toolchain, providing a cleaner architecture, better maintainability, and compliance with IEC 61131-3 version 3.

## Name Origin

The name **STruC++** is a portmanteau that reflects the compiler's purpose and design philosophy:

- **ST** - Structured Text, the primary IEC 61131-3 programming language this compiler targets
- **ru** - From the root word "stru" meaning "to build" or "construct," found in English words like "structure," "construct," and "instruct"
- **C++** - The target language for code generation

The name embodies the compiler's mission: to bridge Structured Text and C++, two powerful tools for building industrial automation systems. Just as "structure" and "construct" relate to building and arranging things systematically, STruC++ builds a bridge between the high-level expressiveness of ST and the performance and flexibility of C++.

## Project Goals

STruC++ aims to overcome the limitations of MatIEC while maintaining compatibility with the OpenPLC ecosystem:

### Primary Objectives

1. **Modern Architecture** - Clean, maintainable TypeScript codebase with clear separation of concerns
2. **IEC 61131-3 v3 Compliance** - Full support for version 3 features including references, nested comments, and modern type system
3. **Line-by-Line Mapping** - Generate C++ code that maintains 1:1 correspondence with ST source for debugging
4. **C++ Native** - Generate idiomatic C++ code leveraging classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
5. **Real-Time Performance** - Produce efficient, deterministic code suitable for PLC applications
6. **Maintainability** - Straightforward implementation that is easy to understand, extend, and debug
7. **Browser-Ready** - Designed to run in both Node.js and browser environments for seamless editor integration

### Key Improvements Over MatIEC

- **Simpler Architecture** - Multi-pass pipeline with explicit data structures instead of complex visitor patterns
- **Better Type System** - C++ wrapper classes for IEC types instead of heavy macro-based access
- **Modern Language** - TypeScript implementation enabling type-safe development, browser compatibility, and seamless integration with OpenPLC Editor
- **Enhanced Debugging** - Built-in support for source-level debugging with line mapping
- **Cleaner Output** - Readable C++ code without excessive macro usage
- **Extensibility** - Modular design allowing easy addition of new features and optimizations

## Architecture Overview

STruC++ follows a multi-pass compilation pipeline:

1. **Frontend** - Lexical analysis and parsing to produce an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
2. **Symbol Table Building** - Global indexing of POUs, types, and constants
3. **Semantic Analysis** - Type checking, overload resolution, and semantic validation
4. **IR Generation** - Lowering to a statement-level Intermediate Representation
5. **Code Generation** - Emission of C++ code with line mapping metadata

For detailed architecture information, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## IEC 61131-3 Compliance

STruC++ targets full compliance with IEC 61131-3 Edition 3.0 **Structured Text (ST) language**, including:

- **Structured Text (ST) only** - STruC++ compiles ST programs exclusively
  - Other IEC languages (IL, FBD, LD, SFC) are supported via OpenPLC Editor's translation to ST
  - The editor converts graphical and other textual languages to ST before compilation
- Modern type system with references (REF_TO, REF, DREF, ^, NULL)
- Nested comments
- Function blocks, functions, and programs
- User-defined types (structures, enumerations, arrays)
- All standard data types and functions
- Full project structure (CONFIGURATION, RESOURCE, TASK, program instances)

For detailed compliance information, see [docs/IEC61131_COMPLIANCE.md](docs/IEC61131_COMPLIANCE.md).

## Implementation Status

STruC++ is currently in **Phase 0 - Repository Setup**. The foundation is in place with a working lexer, parser, and test infrastructure.

### Current Phase: Phase 0 - Repository Setup (Complete)

- ✅ Architecture design
- ✅ Parser library selection (Chevrotain)
- ✅ Implementation roadmap
- ✅ Project structure and build system
- ✅ Chevrotain-based lexer with all IEC 61131-3 tokens
- ✅ Parser with grammar rules for POUs, statements, and expressions
- ✅ Symbol table with scope management
- ✅ Test infrastructure (66 passing tests)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ⏳ Phase 1: IEC Types and Runtime (next)

For the complete implementation roadmap, see [docs/implementation-phases/](docs/implementation-phases/).

## Technology Stack

- **Implementation Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **Parser**: Chevrotain - see [docs/PARSER_SELECTION.md](docs/PARSER_SELECTION.md) for rationale
- **Target Language**: C++17 or later
- **Build System**: npm/pnpm for compiler, CMake for C++ runtime
- **Testing**: Vitest for compiler tests, Google Test for C++ runtime tests
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ or modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git
- C++17 compatible compiler (optional, for testing generated code)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Autonomy-Logic/STruCpp.git
cd STruCpp

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build the compiler
npm run build
```

### Building the Standalone Executable

To create a single-file bundled executable that can be distributed without requiring users to install dependencies:

```bash
# Build the bundled executable
npm run build:bundle
```

This creates `dist/strucpp-bundle.cjs`, a single CommonJS file (~5KB) that includes all dependencies. You can run it directly with Node.js:

```bash
# Run the bundled executable
node dist/strucpp-bundle.cjs --help
node dist/strucpp-bundle.cjs --version
```

The bundled executable requires Node.js 18+ to run, but does not require `npm install` since all dependencies are bundled.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Check code formatting
npm run format:check

# Format code
npm run format

# Type check without building
npm run typecheck

# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

### Usage (Future - Not Yet Implemented)

The compiler CLI and programmatic API are scaffolded but not yet functional. Full compilation will be available in Phase 3+.

```bash
# Compile an ST program to C++ (CLI) - FUTURE
npx strucpp input.st -o output.cpp

# Compile with debug information - FUTURE
npx strucpp input.st -o output.cpp --debug --line-mapping

# Show help - FUTURE
npx strucpp --help
```

```typescript
// Programmatic usage (Browser or Node.js) - FUTURE
import { compile } from 'strucpp';

const stSource = `
PROGRAM Main
  VAR counter : INT; END_VAR
  counter := counter + 1;
END_PROGRAM
`;

const result = compile(stSource, { debug: true, lineMapping: true });
console.log(result.cppCode);
console.log(result.lineMap);
```
