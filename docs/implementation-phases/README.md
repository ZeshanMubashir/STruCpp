# STruC++ Implementation Phases

This directory contains the detailed implementation plan for STruC++, organized into phases and sub-phases. Each phase delivers a vertical slice of functionality that can be validated independently.

## Overview

STruC++ development follows a phased approach where each phase builds upon the previous one. The phases are designed to deliver incremental, testable functionality.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 0: Design and Planning
**Status**: COMPLETED

Established project foundation and detailed design documentation.

**Document**: [phase-0-design.md](phase-0-design.md)

### Phase 1: IEC Types, Runtime, and Library Architecture
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 6-8 weeks

Design and implement the foundational C++ runtime architecture. This phase is divided into sub-phases for manageable implementation.

**Sub-phases**:
- [Phase 1.1: Core IEC Type Wrappers](phase-1.1-core-types.md) - Basic type definitions with forcing support
- [Phase 1.2: Type Categories and Traits](phase-1.2-type-traits.md) - C++ concepts/traits for IEC type categories
- [Phase 1.3: Time and Date Types](phase-1.3-time-types.md) - TIME, DATE, TOD, DT implementations
- [Phase 1.4: String Types](phase-1.4-string-types.md) - STRING and WSTRING with operations
- [Phase 1.5: Composite Types](phase-1.5-composite-types.md) - Arrays, Structures, Enumerations
- [Phase 1.6: Standard Functions and Library](phase-1.6-standard-functions.md) - Numeric, conversion, and variadic functions

### Phase 2: Project Structure and User-Defined Types
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 5-7 weeks

Parse IEC 61131-3 project structure and user-defined data types, generating C++ class hierarchy for runtime scheduling and type definitions.

**Sub-phases**:
- [Phase 2.1: Project Structure and Scheduling Model](phase-2.1-project-structure.md) - Parse CONFIGURATION, RESOURCE, TASK, program instances
- [Phase 2.2: User-Defined Data Types](phase-2.2-user-data-types.md) - Parse TYPE declarations (enumerations, structures, arrays, subranges)

### Phase 3: Core ST Translation
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 4-6 weeks

Implement parser and code generator for basic ST expressions, assignments, and simple statements.

**Document**: [phase-3-st-translation.md](phase-3-st-translation.md)

### Phase 4: Functions and Function Calls
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 4-6 weeks

Add support for user-defined functions and standard library functions.

**Document**: [phase-4-functions.md](phase-4-functions.md)

### Phase 5: Function Blocks and Classes
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 6-8 weeks

Implement function blocks as C++ classes with state and methods.

**Document**: [phase-5-function-blocks.md](phase-5-function-blocks.md)

### Phase 6: Located Variables and OpenPLC Integration
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 3-4 weeks

Add support for located variables and integrate with OpenPLC runtime.

**Document**: [phase-6-openplc-integration.md](phase-6-openplc-integration.md)

### Phase 7: IEC v3 Features and Full Coverage
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 6-8 weeks

Implement IEC 61131-3 Edition 3 features and complete language coverage.

**Document**: [phase-7-iec-v3-features.md](phase-7-iec-v3-features.md)

### Phase 8: Optimizations and Advanced Debug Support
**Status**: PENDING | **Duration**: 4-6 weeks

Optimize generated code and enhance debugging capabilities.

**Document**: [phase-8-optimizations.md](phase-8-optimizations.md)

## Phasing Philosophy

Each phase follows these principles:

1. **Vertical Slices** - Each phase delivers end-to-end functionality (parsing -> semantic analysis -> code generation)
2. **Incremental Complexity** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
3. **Always Testable** - Every phase produces a working compiler for a subset of the language
4. **Clear Deliverables** - Each phase has specific, measurable completion criteria
5. **Independent Validation** - Each phase can be validated without completing later phases

## Success Criteria

For each phase to be considered complete:

- All planned features are implemented
- Unit tests pass (>90% coverage for new code)
- Integration tests pass (golden file tests)
- Line mapping is correct for all generated code
- Generated C++ compiles without errors
- Generated C++ produces correct runtime behavior
- Documentation is updated

## MatIEC Reference

The runtime library architecture is informed by MatIEC's design, while addressing its limitations:

- **MatIEC**: Heavy macro usage, C target, IEC v2 compliance
- **STruC++**: C++ templates, minimal macros, IEC v3 compliance

Key MatIEC components referenced:
- `lib/C/iec_types.h` - Basic type definitions
- `lib/C/iec_types_all.h` - Type wrappers with forcing flags
- `lib/C/accessor.h` - Variable access macros
- `lib/C/iec_std_lib.h` - Helper functions
- `lib/C/iec_std_functions.h` - Standard IEC functions
- `lib/C/iec_std_FB.h` - Standard function blocks
